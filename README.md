### About Project

#### *FrontEnd Developer*
[Peyman Naderi](https://github.com/peymanath)
We have used the latest version of Next.js for the development of this project, and it's implemented based on the architecture commonly found in Large Scale Projects (LSP). Additionally, we've utilized TypeScript for managing types in JavaScript. For state management, we've employed Zustand and React Query (React Query). In terms of styling, we've chosen Tailwind CSS.

The project is currently a work in progress, and as it nears completion, we'll provide you with more detailed and refined information.

#### **BackEnd Developer**
[Atefe Asgariyan](https://github.com/atefe-aa)
This project aims to provide a foundation for creating powerful web applications with a focus on the backend logic. Here's what you can expect:
Laravel Framework: I've built this API using the Laravel framework, a robust and developer-friendly PHP framework that ensures security, scalability, and maintainability.
RESTful API: The project follows RESTful API principles, making it easy to interact with from the front-end applications, including those built with React.js.
Ongoing Learning: This is a project in progress. I'm continuously learning and improving the codebase. Feel free to provide feedback, suggestions, or contribute to its development.

#### *UI/UX Design*

project. [Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/9PZFhesaQ1kW6UdpbVA7yz/Tarkhineh-%7C-Food-ordering-Website-%26-Application-(Community))
We've just completed a project involving the design of an online food ordering interface for a well-known chain of restaurants, Trakhine. Throughout the design process, we encountered various challenges that prompted us to think creatively and work together seamlessly.

The objective of this project was to deliver an engaging and user-friendly website for customers. To achieve this goal, we carefully examined and evaluated various resources, taking into consideration different possibilities and leveraging design principles and rules to create a unique user experience. After weeks of hard work, we have finally completed the project, resulting in a functional website that fulfills the needs of our customers. We hope that Trakhine becomes a valuable resource for its users.

As the designers behind this product, we take pride in our contribution and eagerly anticipate its growth and evolution in the future.
